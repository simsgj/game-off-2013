Game starts with the 4 players (wizards) positioned at the 4 corners of the map. The goal is to reach the fountain of 
endless energy in the center of the map. On each turn, players can choose whether to throw the dice of *chance* or 
cast a *spell*. Wizards move only forward on predefined spiral-alike paths. Paths can be seen on each player's move.

## Chance

Throw the dice and let *Chance* determines what happens next. 

Side | Action | Description
-----|--------|-----------------
1    | Move   | Move 1 tile ahead
2    | Move   | Move 2 tiles ahead
3    | Numb   | Skip 1 turn
4    | Mana   | Mana +1
5    | Mana   | Mana +2
6    | Jump/Teleport | Jump 2 tiles ahead. If destination tile is Abyss teleport will fail.

## Spells & Mana

All players start with 10 points of mana. Mana does **not** get replenished over time! 
The only way to replenish mana is to get 4 or 5 when throwing the dice.

Wizards have two types of spells available - *common* and *special*. *Common* can be casted by all wizards and *special* 
is a spell available only to the particular wizard.

Name | Caster | Duration | Mana Cost | Description
-----|--------|----------|-----------|-------------
Abyss Call | All | 3 turns | 4 | Creates a hole on a target tile. Rival players cannot cross that tile unless they throw Jump.
Change to Stone | All | 3 turns | 3 | Wizards that stand on such tiles are  immune to spells.

## Story

It is very rare for humans to achieve the status of a higher being. This requires absolute devotion to the ethereal. To the very fabrics that space constitutes of. Those who learn how to thread these fabrics, twist them and control them, will then get elevated closer to the higher presence.
